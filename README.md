# BlazarArchive

An incredibly simplistic, inelegant artifact manager.  For my personal needs, I don't need all the
capabilities of nexus or even archiva (which does not seem to work on mac anymore).  So rather than
trying to find one that does, just do this which does what I need and nothing more.
